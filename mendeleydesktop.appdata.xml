    <p>
      Mendeley is a combination of a desktop application and a website which
      helps you manage, share and discover both content and contacts in research.
    </p>
    <p>Our software, Mendeley Desktop, offers you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Automatic extraction of document details (authors, title, journal etc.)
        from academic papers into a library database, which saves you a lot of
        manual typing! As more people use Mendeley, the quality of the data
        extraction improves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Super-efficient management of your papers: "Live" full-text search across
        all your papers â€“ the results start to appear as you type! Mendeley
        Desktop also lets you filter your library by authors, journals or keywords.
        You can also use document collections, notes and tags to organize your
        knowledge, and export the document details in different citation styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sharing and synchronization of your library (or parts of it) with
        selected colleagues. This is perfect for jointly managing all the papers in
        your lab!
      </li>
      <li>
        More great features: A plug-in for citing your articles in Microsoft
        Word, OCR (image-to-text conversion, so you can full-text search all your
        scanned PDFs) and lots more new features being worked upon.
      </li>
    </ul>
